# Car-and-Motorcycle-Detection-and-Tracking-through-the-DJI-Tello-minidrone

A simple Python script used to programme the DJI Tello minidrone to make it able to detect and track people.

The mobileNet-SSD has been used for the detection task.

We've changed the code to make it specifically detect and track car or motorcycle.

Before the detection start, we can control the drone using the keyboard controller.

[Space] : to take off or to land
